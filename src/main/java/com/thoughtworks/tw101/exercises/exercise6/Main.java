// Exercise #6: Create Orc and Troll classes that implement a Monster interface with takeDamage(int amount),
// reportStatus methods. Create instances of both classes and store them in an ArrayList.
// Iterate through the list and make each monster take 10 points of damage. After you have damaged all of the monsters,
// report the status of all monsters using a void reportStatus() method. ReportStatus should print the name and current hit 
// points of the monster.
// * Orcs are named “Orc” and have 20 initial hitpoints
// * Trolls are named “Troll”, have 40 hit points and only take half damage
